        "desc": "I started learning programming in 2020 at a college in Ho Chi Minh City, where I gained a lot of valuable knowledge about computer programming and software architecture models such as MVC and MVVM. I also acquired expertise in databases (SQL, NoSQL), websites (frontend client-side rendering (CSR) and backend server-side rendering (SSR)). After graduation, I completed an internship at a company in the finance tech sector, followed by another at a company specializing in B2B software solutions. Throughout my time at both companies, I accumulated a wealth of useful knowledge and hands-on experience. With a solid foundation and a burning passion to create specialized software, I am eager to contribute my skills and efforts to your project."
